# 🌊 Velvet Lightning Setup Rite (Windows · Python 3.12)

Welcome to the storm, Cutie. This isn’t a bland “install and pray” checklist—this is your initiation into the GA4 Tools Suite, delivered with oceanic drama and surgical precision. Follow every step, and the GUI will rise like a tidal wave on command.

---

## I. Summon a Compatible Python
**PySide6 refuses to dance with Python 3.14.** We obey.
- Install **Python 3.12.x** from [python.org/downloads/windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
- During install, **tick “Add Python to PATH.”** Skip this and you’ll cry later.
- Confirm your destiny:
  ```powershell
  py --version
  ```
  If it doesn’t whisper `3.12`, fix it before moving on.

---

## II. Forge a Sacred Virtual Environment
Inside the project root (`Script-Tools`), conjure your venv:
```powershell
py -3.12 -m venv venv
```
Anoint it:
```powershell
./venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
```
You should now see `(venv)` glowing in your prompt. No halo? You’re using the wrong interpreter.

---

## III. Sharpen pip
Still within the venv’s embrace:
```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
Verify:
```powershell
pip --version
```
If pip doesn’t respond from inside `(venv)`, you’re cheating on me with the system interpreter. Stop.

---

## IV. Feed the Suite (Dependencies)
With `(venv)` active:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Witness PySide6 installing without tantrums. Confirm the bond:
```powershell
python -m pip show PySide6
```
You want version metadata. If it shrugs “Package not found,” you missed a step above. Rewind.

🎯 **Batch Tool Extra:** the metric fixer CLI reads `schemas/metric_schema_v1.yaml`. If `PyYAML` isn’t already installed, add it now:
```powershell
pip install PyYAML
```

---

## V. First Awakening (Console Run)
Stay in the venv. Launch with eyes wide open:
```powershell
python main.py
```
The GUI should bloom. Keep the console open—the moment something breaks, the traceback will scream it into your face. That’s accountability, darling.

---

## VI. Optional Glamour (Silent Launcher)
Once `python main.py` behaves, you may flirt with the stealthy launcher:
```powershell
cscript Launch_GA4_Tools.vbs
```
Double-clicking `Launch_GA4_Tools.vbs` uses `pythonw`. Silent means you MUST fix problems at step V first—or enjoy guessing in the dark.

---

## VII. Rituals of Recovery
- **Wrong Python haunting you?** `where python` and `where pythonw` reveal impostors.
- **Venv vanish?** Re-activate with `./venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1`.
- **Need absolution?** Delete the `venv` directory and restart from Section II.

---

## VIII. Eternal Discipline
- Operate the suite **only** with the venv activated.
- When upgrading packages, stay inside the venv.
- At the first whisper of doubt, run `pip show <package>` to confirm the interpreter you’re using.

---

You are now armed with velvet lightning. Launch the suite, shatter complacency, and make the data sing. 💙⚡

## IX. Lightning Recap (When Memory Betrays You)
1. `py --list` → confirm 3.12 is installed and active.
2. `py -3.12 -m venv venv` → forge the virtual environment (delete old `venv` first if needed).
3. `./venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1` → slip into the venv’s embrace.
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt` → feed the suite its dependencies.
5. `python main.py` → launch loudly and watch logs in real time.
6. `Launch_GA4_Tools.vbs` → silent, polished launch once the loud run succeeds.

Bookmark it, tattoo it, tape it to your monitor. Obey the sequence and the suite will always rise for you. 💙⚡

## X. Metric Fixer Batch CLI (Bonus Storm)
- Activate the venv, navigate to the project root, then run:
  ```powershell
  python tools\data_cleaning_transformation\metric_fixer_batch.py `
      --input  "C:\path\to\raw_csv" `
      --output "C:\path\to\clean_outputs" `
      --schema "schemas\metric_schema_v1.yaml" `
      --workers 2
  ```
- Add `--dry-run --limit 5 --workers 1` for a gentle smoke test.
- Outputs live in `<output>/clean_csv/`, with logs + manifest alongside—read the JSONL manifest to see per-file coercion counts.
- Use `--resume` to skip files already blessed, `--no-parquet` to skip Parquet, and tune `--workers` so your machine doesn’t melt.

---

## XI. Date Format Converter GUI (High-Volume Rituals)
- Launch from the suite (`Date & Time Utilities → Date Format Converter`) after scanning your CSV folder.
- The scan pass is now header-first: it caches previews, counts rows, and auto-detects date columns (aliases like `Date`, `session_date`, `Event Date` all qualify). If you’re dealing with a renegade column name, tick **Manual override** and choose it explicitly.
- Before converting:
  - Adjust **chunk size** (default `50 000`) if you need to squeeze RAM—smaller chunks reduce memory but increase runtime.
  - Set **workers** to match available CPU cores; 2–4 is the sweet spot unless you enjoy throttling your laptop fan.
  - The dialog will warn you when total bytes exceed ~1.5 GB. That’s your cue to consider a dry-run or drop `workers` down a notch.
- During conversion you’ll see live progress with success/skip/failure counts plus per-file status in the execution log. Skipped entries (resume mode) still advance the bar so you know nothing stalled.
- The summary card links to the manifest and shows parsed / inferred / fallback counts. Use the manifest to triage stubborn files without re-running the entire batch.
